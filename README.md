# Angela-CV
This is my first cv assignment followed by Angela's tutorials. This website is made only by using html. I should really pay attention to the "table" and "form" parts because I don't quite good at writing codes about these two parts. And also I need to make sure I totally understand the steps of publishing my files on github.
